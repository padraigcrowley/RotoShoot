[-- Note: the UniqueProjectiles Pack's projectiles need rotating 90 around Y if used in 2D games / 2D mode !!!
When spawning the projectile, rotate it 90 around the Y, like so:
Quaternion thisRotation = Quaternion.identity;
thisRotation.eulerAngles = new Vector3(0, 90, 0); // !!! 
spawnInstance = SimplePool.Spawn(playerMissilePrefab, shootingPos, thisRotation);   --]


- Change the tag to "EnemyMisssile" or whatever relevant
- change the Boxx Collider and Rigid Body components to their 2D equivalents.Base them on previous working ones.
- Change/edit the above 2D fields.
- replace the "projectile move" script with your own
- in the scriptcomponent, fill in the relevant public fields/prefabs
- compare the particle fx (and children particle fx) with a previous working one
- e.g. check that "Auto-Destroy" isn't on any of the particles/sub particles systems - it shouldn't be (because we're using pooling we don't want to destroy elements, as this will throw up an error when we try to re-use/re-Enable them)
